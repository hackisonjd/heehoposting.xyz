# Heehoposting.xyz (https://heehoposting.xyz)

Heehoposting is my personal website and portfolio, made with Flask and about three 2 liter Dr Pepper bottles. :^)

## Installation process

This is a website, so no installation necessary. If you want to modify/improve this project, clone this and install the latest version of Python and pip. Download the packages from the requirements file.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

If you don't want to look like an idiot, use a virtual environment.
