- A discord bot to put on my own personal server 
- Gradual changes to my homelab, which i will be writing about soon right here! 

** I am currently learning: **

- Designing small applications in java using recursion, exceptions, and file i/o 
- Discrete mathematical structures and proofs 
- Cybersecurity analysis and implementation 
- Underlying principles of telecommunications and how to provide efficient and secure networks. 

I like video games a lot, some personal favorites are the Shin Megami Tensei series, Yakuza 0, and Guilty Gear Strive. i am also a big Dungeons and Dragons guy and like TCGs such as Magic: the Gathering.
