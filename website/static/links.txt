** Useful Links**
<hr>

These are all websites/services that I found to be helpful when making this website. They are posted below for your consideration.

- This website is powered by a [Python](https://www.python.org/) micro-web framework called Flask! The documentation is freely available [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/).
    - I also referenced [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uswgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04) quite a bit.
- [Want a free and open-source alternative to software you use?](https://alternativeto.net/)
- [Here is a collection of 88x31 buttons](http://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/). Truly, these are a blast from the past. :)
- [Want to know how I got this fancy CRT effect](http://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html)? Shoutouts to [Alec Lownes](https://twitter.com/alec_lownes).
- All of the pages are written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) formatting. Much better than hard-coding HTML, no? ;)
